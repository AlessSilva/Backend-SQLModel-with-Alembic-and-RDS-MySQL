# Backend-SQLModel-with-Alembic-and-RDS-MySQL

### The Python backend project utilizes the Serverless Framework to establish endpoints enabling BREAD operations (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, and Delete) on an RDS MySQL database. For object-relational mapping (ORM), SQLModel is employed, enabling declarative definition of Python models that align seamlessly with the database structure. Moreover, Alembic is integrated to handle database migrations, ensuring continuous schema updates in response to model changes.

### Here are the main topics covered in the Python backend project:

1. **Serverless Framework:**

2. **SQLModel:**

4. **Endpoints BREAD:**

5. **Alembic:**
