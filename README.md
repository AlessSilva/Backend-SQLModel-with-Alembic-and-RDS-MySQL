# Backend-SQLModel-with-Alembic-and-RDS-MySQL

## The Python backend project was developed using the Serverless Framework to create endpoints that perform BREAD operations (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, and Delete) on an RDS MySQL database. For object-relational mapping (ORM), the project adopted the SQLModel library, which allows declarative definition of Python models aligned with the database structure. Additionally, the project integrates Alembic to manage database migrations, ensuring that the schema is always updated according to changes in the models.

## Here are the main topics covered in the Python backend project:

1. **Serverless Framework:**

2. **SQLModel:**

4. **Endpoints BREAD:**

5. **Alembic:**
